 Let's think step by step to describe the solution, and
 break the solution down in task list based on the guidance mentioned above.
 And we will refer this task list as our master plan.

Besides these new task ,and the following task at high priorty
1. Add the task to create database and table in high priority
2. Add the task create the project skeleton
