ure, here's a revised master plan that includes more detailed component names, methods, and properties:

1. Create a new database for the school information system.
    - Use MySQL as the database management system.
    - Create a new database called "school_info".
    - Set up a new user with appropriate privileges to access the database.

2. Create a new table called "students" with the following columns:
    - id (INT): primary key for the student
    - name (VARCHAR): name of the student
    - score (INT): score of the student
    - Use a database management tool, such as MySQL Workbench, to create this table in the "school_info" database.

3. Create a new controller class called "StudentController" to handle the API requests for student information.
    - Use Spring Boot as the web framework.
    - Use the @RestController annotation to indicate that this class will handle REST API requests.
    - Define a @RequestMapping annotation for the API endpoint URL.
    - Inject an instance of the StudentService component into this class using the @Autowired annotation.
    - Add a method to handle GET requests for retrieving student scores by ID.

4. Create a new service class called "StudentService" to handle the business logic for retrieving student scores.
    - Use the @Service annotation to indicate that this class is a Spring service component.
    - Inject an instance of the StudentDAO component into this class using the @Autowired annotation.
    - Define a method in this class to retrieve student scores by ID.

5. Create a new DAO (Data Access Object) class called "StudentDAO" to handle the data retrieval from the database.
    - Use MyBatis as the ORM framework for this component.
    - Define a mapper interface using the @Mapper annotation.
    - Define a method in this interface to retrieve student scores by ID.
    - Use MyBatis XML mapping files to map the SQL queries to Java objects.

6. Utilize Junit for writing unit tests to ensure the API function properly as expected.
    - Use the @RunWith and @SpringBootTest annotations to run the tests with Spring Boot.
    - Inject an instance of the StudentController class into the test class using the @Autowired annotation.
    - Write test methods to call the API endpoint and verify the response.

7. Deploy the application on the web server, such as Tomcat, JBoss, etc.
    - Package the application as a JAR file using Maven.
    - Install a web server on the deployment machine.
    - Copy the JAR file to the web server's deployment directory.
    - Start the web server and verify that the API endpoint is accessible.

8. Implement the API documentation in Swagger.
    - Use the springfox-swagger2 and springfox-swagger-ui libraries to generate Swagger documentation.
    - Define the API endpoint in the Swagger configuration.
    - Run the application and access the Swagger UI to view the documentation.

Note: The component names, methods, and properties are subject to change based on the specific requirements and design of your project.
