The current system is web-based online school information system.It will query student,teacher and course information by API andlater will show the information in the web page.
Technology stack:
    java, Spring Boot for web framework, maven for build , mybatis for ORM ,mysql, junit for unit test .All code should be written in the tech stack mentioned above.
Architecture:
  1. the system has 3 layers, controller, service and dao.
 Constraint:
  1. The api will follow rest-api style.
  2. Test-driven code are preferred.

Now to implement the Requirement.
Requirement:
 1. Query student score by student ID

Provide an overall solution following the guidance mentioned above.Donâ€™t generate code.
 Let's think step by step to describe the solution, and
 break the solution down in task list based on the guidance mentioned above.
 And we will refer this task list as our master plan.

The following are the task list:
1. Create a new database for the school information system.
2. Create a new table called "students" with the following columns:
- id (INT): primary key for the student
- name (VARCHAR): name of the student
- score (INT): score of the student
3. Create a new controller class called "StudentController" to handle the API requests for student information.
4. Define a new API endpoint in the StudentController to retrieve student scores by student ID.
5. Create a new service class called "StudentService" to handle the business logic for retrieving student scores.
6. Define a method in the StudentService class to retrieve student scores by student ID.
7. Create a new DAO (Data Access Object) class called "StudentDAO" to handle the data retrieval from the database.
8. Define a method in the StudentDAO class to retrieve student scores by student ID.
9. Use the MyBatis ORM framework to map the SQL queries to Java objects.
10. Utilize Junit for writing unit tests to ensure the API function properly as expected.
11. Implement the API documentation in Swagger.
12. Deploy the application on the web server, such as Tomcat, JBoss, etc.

Please let me know if there are any additional tasks you would like added to the master plan.


===========

1. Create the project skeleton with Java, Spring Boot for web framework, Maven for build, and MyBatis for ORM.
2. Create the database and table for storing student score information.
3. Define the REST API endpoint for querying student score by student ID.
4. Implement controller layer logic to handle the API request and response.
5. Implement service layer logic to retrieve student score from the database using the DAO layer.
6. Implement DAO layer logic to retrieve student score from the database using MyBatis ORM.
7. Write unit tests for controller, service, and DAO layers to ensure code quality and functionality.
8. Integrate all layers together to ensure proper functionality of the whole system.
9. Deploy the web application on Tomcat web container for access by users.
